## üîß Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

<details>
<summary>Services show as unavailable</summary>

1. Check if Docker containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```

2. Ensure the Docker API service is accessible:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3001/api/docker/health
```

3. If containers aren't visible, restart the Docker API:
```bash
docker restart alfredos-docker-api
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Certificate warnings in browser</summary>

AlfredOS uses self-signed certificates by default. You can:
1. Accept the self-signed certificate in your browser
2. Set up Let's Encrypt for proper SSL certificates
```bash
# Edit the install.sh file and set
ENABLE_LETSENCRYPT=true
DOMAIN_NAME="your-domain.com"
ADMIN_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>License key validation fails</summary>

1. Ensure you're using the exact license key provided after purchase
2. Check your internet connection (needed to validate the license)
3. If you're behind a corporate firewall, ensure outbound HTTPS access to:
   - `ojflhjvssqramhexvclr.functions.supabase.co`
   - `github.com`
4. Contact support if problems persist
